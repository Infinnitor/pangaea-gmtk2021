# gamists-gmtk-2021
This project was made for the 2021 GMTK game jam. The theme for that jam was "joined together" so we decided to make a game about a continent joining together with other continents. The main focus of our game ended up being on the dialogue as it sort of morphed into a visual novel.

We didn't really manage to come up with a good gameplay link for the theme, so we settled on having the continents play Xs and Os with each other to decide whether or not they would join.

The time we had to make the game was 48 hours, however we finished it in less than that. This was our first game jam, and there were a lot of mistakes along with messy code, but we enjoyed taking part in the jam.

Everything below is out notes that we took while brainstorming / making the game.
