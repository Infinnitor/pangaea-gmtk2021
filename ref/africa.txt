PANGAEA: Hey, Africa! : happy
AFRICA: Oh, hey there, Pangaea! All well? : happy
PANGAEA: Yeah! I'm actually here with a proposition of sorts. : happy
AFRICA: Oh, okay. What is it? : happy
PANGAEA: Well, you know how all us continents are just kind of... drifting around, |only seeing each other every few million years? : happy
AFRICA: Yeah? : sad
PANGAEA: Well, wouldn't it be nice if we saw each other more regularly? : happy
AFRICA: I suppose... I haven't really thought much about it. |The other continents don't converse much with me. : sad
PANGAEA: Well, that's my point exactly. And I think I have a solution... : happy
PANGAEA: We all move in together! |In the same spot in the ocean! What do you say? : happy
AFRICA: Oh, wow... I don't know. It seems a bit radical. : sad
PANGAEA: Well, how about I make it easier for you - We play a game of exes and ohs. |If I win, you're in. And if you win... : happy
PANGAEA: You get to play me again and again until I win. : happy
AFRICA: Doesn't sound like I have much in the way of choice, here. : angry
PANGAEA: Hey, at least you'll get to spend more time with me either way. : happy
