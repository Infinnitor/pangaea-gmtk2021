EURASIA: (spits out tea) Pangaea, is that you?
PANGAEA: “Pangaea” is dead. My name is... actually, my name is still Pangaea, |I'm just bigger now, I guess.
EURASIA: You did it... you got all the other continents to join your little club. |I have to say, I'm impressed.
PANGAEA: Wow, Eurasia, are you complimenting me? |And it's not even a backhanded compliment!
EURASIA: Well, I kind of implied that I didn't think you had it in you. |Don't flatter yourself there, Pangaea.
PANGAEA: Whatever. So, have you reconsidered now that you can see all the fun you're missing out on?
EURASIA: You know what... yeah, actually. I have.
PANGAEA: Really? Wow, that was... not the answer I was expecting from you, Eurasia.
EURASIA: ...But only on one condition: I get to be the supercontinent's namesake.
PANGAEA: Woah, woah woah, hold it there, pal. |You can't just dismiss my idea and then try to hijack it when it starts to come to fruition. |If you're joining, it's under my name.
NORTH AMERICA: Challenge them to exes and ohs, Pangy!
AFRICA: Yeah, you beat all of us at the game! This won't be any different!
EURASIA: You heard your friends, Pangaea. We'll settle this disagreement over a simple little game of exes and ohs. |If you win, you get to keep your name and if I win... |Eurasia will get a whole lot bigger.
