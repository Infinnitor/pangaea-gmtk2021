(Australia's text is upside down)
PANGAEA: G'day, Australia!
AUSTRALIA: You don't have to say “g'day” when you're talking to me, mate.
PANGAEA: Uh... yeah, haha. Anyway, I've got this idea, you wanna hear?
AUSTRALIA: Why not. Shoot.
PANGAEA: ...I'll just take that as a yes. Okay, so, basically the idea is that all the continents live together, |as opposed to apart, which is obviously the way things are at the moment. |How does that sound to you?
AUSTRALIA: Yeah, that sounds alright.
PANGAEA: ...I'm sorry, I'm having a little difficulty understanding what you're saying.
AUSTRALIA: I said that sounds alright, mate!
PANGAEA: ...Yeah, I'm sorry man, I still have no idea what you're saying. How about we decide over exes and ohs?
AUSTRALIA: There is literally no need for... oh, whatever. Let's get this done with.
