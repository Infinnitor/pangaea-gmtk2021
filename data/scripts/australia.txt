PANGAEA: G'day, Australia! : happy
AUSTRALIA: You don't have to say "g'day" when you're talking to me, mate. : angry
PANGAEA: Uh... yeah, haha. Anyway, I've got this idea, you wanna hear? : happy
AUSTRALIA: Why not. Shoot. : happy
PANGAEA: ...I'll just take that as a yes. |Okay, so, basically the idea is that all the continents live together, |as opposed to apart, which is obviously the way things are at the moment. : happy
PANGAEA: How does that sound to you? : happy
AUSTRALIA: Yeah, that sounds alright. : happy
PANGAEA: ...I'm sorry, I'm having a little difficulty understanding |what you're saying. : sad
AUSTRALIA: I said that sounds alright, mate! : angry
PANGAEA: ...Yeah, I'm sorry man, I still have no idea what you're saying. |How about we decide over exes and ohs? : happy
AUSTRALIA: There is literally no need for... oh, whatever. Let's get this done with. : angry
