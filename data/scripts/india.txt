PANGAEA: India!
INDIA: Pangaea.
PANGAEA: What is up, buddy?
INDIA: Nothing.
PANGAEA: Nothing? Well, isn't that a shame. |If only there was something somebody could do about thatâ€¦
INDIA: ...
PANGAEA: ...Aren't you going to ask me if there's something I can do about that?
INDIA: Why would I do that?
PANGAEA: ...Because I implied there is something I can do about that? |With the tone of my voice?
INDIA: What if I don't care?
PANGAEA: ...Don't you want some excitement in your life?
INDIA: There has never once been excitement in my life. |I rose from the ocean and have drifted slowly around for millennia since. |Why now would I suddenly have a craving for something new?
PANGAEA: Well, I don't know about you, |but it sort of seems to me like you need excitement more than you might want it. |And I have the perfect thing to provide you with just the right amount of it.
INDIA: And what would that be?
PANGAEA: A new lifestyle! Picture this: |you, me, and all the other continents together as one super continent!
INDIA: My tectonic plates are quaking at the very thought.
PANGAEA: Oh, come on! It'll be fun! How about this: we play a round of exes and ohs, |and if I win, you come and live with me and the others.
INDIA: Assuming the others are as bad at exes and ohs as I am.
PANGAEA: ...Yeah.
