PANGAEA: Hey there, Eurasia!
EURASIA: What do you want, Pangaea.
PANGAEA: Why do you assume that I want something? |Why can't I just be looking to catch up with an old friend?
EURASIA: I'm a big rock drifting through a sea of nothingness, the same as last time. |There's nothing to "catch up" on. Now, what do you want?
PANGAEA: Well actually, you're wrong, because there is something to catch up on: I have an idea.
EURASIA: Oh, boy.
PANGAEA: You see, I've been thinking: isn't it sad how you, me, |and all the other continents are just drifting around the place, |only bumping into each other every few million years?
EURASIA: No…
PANGAEA: Well, I was thinking it would be nice if we all joined together… permanently! |Like one big supercontinent as opposed to just a bunch of lonely mini continents!
EURASIA: …That is, without a doubt, the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
PANGAEA: Why?!
EURASIA: Because nobody is going to agree to that. We'll all just clash together. |Besides, what would we be called?
PANGAEA: I don't know, I was thinking because it was my idea, |we could all collectively just… go by Pangaea?
EURASIA: Hah! Pangaea, you make me laugh. You will never be a supercontinent.
PANGAEA: Well, you'll know where to find us when we're all throwing our cool party together. |Spoiler alert: it won't be in this miserable corner of the ocean!
