PANGAEA: Hey, Africa!
AFRICA: Oh, hey there, Pangaea! All well?
PANGAEA: Yeah! I'm actually here with a proposition of sorts.
AFRICA; Oh, okay. What is it?
PANGAEA: Well, you know how all us continents are just kind of... drifting around, |only seeing each other every few million years?
AFRICA: Yeah?
PANGAEA: Well, wouldn't it be nice if we saw each other more regularly?
AFRICA: I suppose... I haven't really thought much about it. |The other continents don't converse much with me.
PANGAEA: Well, that's my point exactly. And I think I have a solution: we all move in together! |In the same spot in the ocean! What do you say?
AFRICA: Oh, wow... I don't know. It seems a bit radical.
PANGAEA: Well, how about I make it easier for you: We play a game of exes and ohs. |If I win, you're in. And if you win...
PANGAEA: You get to play me again and again until I win.
AFRICA: Doesn't sound like I have much in the way of choice, here.
PANGAEA: Hey, at least you'll get to spend more time with me either way.
